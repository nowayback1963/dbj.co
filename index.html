    <h1>Hi, I have absolutely no integrity.</h1> 
    <p>I walked away from this business because I’ve never been able to see anything through—commitment isn’t something I’m capable of. Instead, I fill the emptiness by wasting my days on Instagram, posting meaningless pictures of Barbie dolls, hoping someone, anyone, will validate me.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I’ve failed the people who actually mattered—my living, breathing children—so profoundly that they want nothing to do with me now. My escape is pretending this pathetic hobby matters. So, if you feel like watching someone crumble in real time, follow me at @designedbyjo2. It’s all I have left.</p>  </body>
